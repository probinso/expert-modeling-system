# Expert Modeling System (EMS)

The expert modeling system provides tools to develop a SME finder from an
attributed corpus, based on the Author-Topic-Model.

This was a prototype developed for NASA's Jet Propultion lab that matches tickets describing late stage mission critical anomalies with best candidate subject matter experts.
